# Get Your Pass - Ticket Selling Website with XRPL Tokenization

## Overview  
The **Get Your Pass** website showcases a secure and private ticketing system powered by the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This system ensures privacy, security, and efficiency throughout the ticket purchase process, abstracting complexities and protecting sensitive user information.

### Problem Statement  
This PoC aims to address:  
- **Token Lifecycle Management**: Issuance, validation, and revocation of tickets as tokens.  
- **Privacy & Security**: Ensures transaction anonymity, protecting sensitive user details like ticket purchases.  
- **Offline Validation**: Supports ticket validation without continuous interaction with a central authority.  

#### Use Case Example:  
- **Ticketing System**: Tokens represent purchased tickets, ensuring the event organizer doesnâ€™t know the user's identity, while the payment facilitator remains unaware of the ticket purpose.
